Welcome to the RAS GitHub repository. Here, you'll find essential information about our projects and easy access to related repositories. 

This project is housed at Delft Technical University, faculty Mechanical Engineering. We develop maritime automation systems, and provide experimental opportunities for research. 
See also : [https://rasdelft.nl/](https://rasdelft.nl/) for more elaborate descriptions, partnerships and updates. 

For information on the technicalities on the facilities and software, contact faculty technicians [Bart Boogmans](https://github.com/bartboogmans) or [Vittorio Garofano](https://github.com/VGarofano-TUD)

## Facilities & Fleet
We have various bodies of water, both inside and outside, where we regulary conduct experiments with any of our 18 available model scale ships. 
The nature of the testing facilities and vessels vary, to cater various research needs. 

See more detailed descriptions in the [Fleet & Facility overview](https://github.com/RAS-Delft/ras-documentation-overview/edit/main/facilities.md)


### Testing areas
#### Towing Tank
#### Flume Tank
#### Faculty lake

## Control modules
Many components are required to make a ship manouver automated, from sensing, various levels of decision-making, communication to actuation. The modules that are used in the common vessel control stacks within RAS are descirbed in more detail in the [Control Modules overview](https://github.com/RAS-Delft/ras-documentation-overview/edit/main/controlmodules.md).

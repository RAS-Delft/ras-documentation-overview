Welcome to the RAS GitHub repository. Here, you'll find essential information about our projects and easy access to related repositories. 

This project is housed at Delft Technical University, faculty Mechanical Engineering. We develop maritime automation systems, and provide experimental opportunities for research. 
See also : [https://rasdelft.nl/](https://rasdelft.nl/) for more elaborate descriptions, partnerships and updates. 

For information on the technicalities on the facilities and software, contact faculty technicians [Bart Boogmans](https://github.com/bartboogmans) or [Vittorio Garofano](https://github.com/VGarofano-TUD)

## Facilities & Fleet
We have various bodies of water, both inside and outside, where we regulary conduct experiments with any of our 18 available model scale ships. 
The nature of the testing facilities and vessels vary, to cater various research needs. Inside bodies have visual motion tracking systems, whereas outside we rely on ship mounted sensors. 

See more detailed descriptions in the [fleet & facility overview](https://github.com/RAS-Delft/ras-documentation-overview/edit/main/facilities)

## Control modules
Many components are required to make a ship manouver automated, from sensing, various levels of decision-making, communication to actuation. The [control module overview](https://github.com/RAS-Delft/ras-documentation-overview/edit/main/module_overviews) describes modules that are used in the common vessel control stacks within RAS. Most components are developed to work with/on the Robotic Operating System. 

This section describes different software components that we have, how they interface with eachother, and where links to their repositories. 
Our vision is to re-use as much modules as possible when doing experimentals, so we can benefit from previous work and mature existing components.

## Vessel dynamical models
The [vessel model overview](https://github.com/RAS-Delft/ras-documentation-overview/edit/main/vesselmodels) gives the information what we know about the dynamics of the ships. It is intended to document best known models for particular scenarios, what versions are out there, how the measurements are obtained, known limitations and links to measurement reports.

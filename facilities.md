# RAS Facility overview
This section describes details on vessels and testing facilities:

## Vessels
### Delfia

Size: 0.38x0.18m
Amount: 10
Thruster setup: Two continuous rotating azimuths (front & Back). Engines go both forward and backwards.
Equipment: Proximity sensors (acoustic & IR), although this approach is kind of abandoned. Localisation is commonly done with our ceiling mounted motion tracking system.
Use: Generally only for inside. Multi vessel operation & cooperation. 

### Tito Neri

Size: 0.98x0.33m
Amount: 7 in various colours
Thruster setup: Two non continous rotating azimuths at the aft (limits ±135°). Fixed angle bow thruster at the stern. Engines go both forward and backwards.
Equipment: 9 axis inertial measurement unit (3axis linear & 3axis angular accelleration, 3axis magnetometer), Emlid M2+ RTK GNSS (we have our own station to generate correction messages), optional: cameras
Use: Inside with optical motion tracking system and outside with ship mounted localization

### Grey Seabax
Size: 1.37x0.29m
Amount: 1
Equipment: Relatively large deck for various sensors and processing units, such as a Jetson + camera's for neural networks to do optical detection & localisation. 
Use: Inside and outside

### RAS Basement tank
This tank is in development as of december 2023. To be updated...
The purpose of this tank is doing experiments in non-flowing water for surface & underwater robots. 
The approximate surface is 4.0x3.0m at a maximum waterdepth of 1.2m. It will be equipped with optical motion tracking systems similar to the other tanks (for surface operation).
